# Decentralized Lottery System

## Project Title
**Decentralized Lottery** - A Transparent Blockchain Lottery with Verifiable Randomness

## Project Description
The Decentralized Lottery is a smart contract-based lottery system built on Ethereum that ensures complete transparency, fairness, and verifiable randomness. Unlike traditional lotteries that rely on centralized authorities, this system operates entirely on the blockchain using Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to guarantee truly random winner selection.

The platform allows users to participate in time-based or ticket-limited lottery rounds by purchasing tickets with cryptocurrency. Each lottery has configurable parameters including ticket price, duration, and maximum number of tickets. When a lottery ends, Chainlink VRF generates a cryptographically secure random number to select the winner, making the process completely transparent and tamper-proof.

Winners receive 90% of the total prize pool, while 10% goes to the platform as maintenance fees. All lottery results are permanently recorded on the blockchain, providing complete audit trails and historical data accessibility.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the lottery industry by creating a fully decentralized, transparent, and fair lottery system that eliminates the need for trust in centralized authorities. We aim to leverage blockchain technology and cryptographic randomness to provide players with absolute confidence in the fairness of each draw.

We envision a global lottery platform where anyone can participate regardless of geographical location, with instant payouts, complete transparency, and mathematically provable fairness. Our goal is to set a new standard for lottery systems that prioritizes player trust, security, and accessibility while maintaining the excitement and potential rewards of traditional lotteries.

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Functions (6 Main Functions):
1. **`startLottery()`** - Initialize new lottery with custom parameters
2. **`buyTickets()`** - Purchase lottery tickets with cryptocurrency
3. **`endLottery()`** - Trigger lottery completion and winner selection
4. **`fulfillRandomWords()`** - Chainlink VRF callback for random winner selection
5. **`getLotteryInfo()`** - Retrieve current lottery status and statistics
6. **`getPlayerInfo()`** - Get individual player statistics and win probability

### Dependencies:
- **Chainlink VRF V2**: For verifiable randomness
- **OpenZeppelin**: For security standards and utilities
- **Solidity ^0.8.0**: Latest Solidity features and optimizations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Hardhat or Truffle development environment
- Chainlink VRF subscription and LINK tokens
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation & Deployment
1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd decentralized-lottery
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Chainlink VRF**:
   - Create Chainlink VRF subscription
   - Fund subscription with LINK tokens
   - Update constructor parameters with subscription ID and VRF coordinator

3. **Deploy Contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
   ```

4. **Verify Contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contract-address> <constructor-args>
   ```

### Usage Guide
1. **Admin**: Deploy contract and start lottery with `startLottery()`
2. **Players**: Buy tickets using `buyTickets()` with exact ETH amount
3. **Anyone**: End lottery when conditions are met using `endLottery()`
4. **System**: Chainlink VRF automatically selects winner and distributes prizes

## Security Considerations
- All random number generation uses Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness
- Access control mechanisms protect administrative functions
- Emergency withdrawal available only when lottery is closed
- Multiple validation checks prevent common attack vectors
